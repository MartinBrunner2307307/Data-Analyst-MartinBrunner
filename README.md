Project Description: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on UCW Recruitment and selection department
Project Title: UCW Recruitment and selection Department
Objective: The primary goal of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the UCW Recruitment and selection Department dataset to understand the overall process of one of the universities most important areas for success.
Dataset: The UCW Recruitment and selection Department dataset consists of several 
Methodology:
1-	Data Collection and Preparation:
o	Load the UCW Recruitment and selection Department dataset using Python libraries like Pandas.
o	Perform initial data cleaning, which includes handling missing values, correcting data types, and renaming columns for clarity.
2-	Descriptive Statistics:
o	Generate summary statistics (mean, median, mode) for numerical features (like Age and Fare) and frequency distributions for categorical features (like Pclass and Sex).
3-	Data Visualization:
o	Create visualizations to illustrate key insights:
4-	Insights and Findings:
o	Summarize the findings based on data visualizations and statistical analyses, highlighting notable trends and patterns
5-	Conclusion:
o	Discuss the implications of the findings and suggest further analyses or data-driven decisions that could be explored, such as building predictive models to classify survival based on passenger features.
Tools and Technologies:
•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
•	Jupyter Notebook for interactive data exploration
•	Any additional data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI (optional)
Deliverables:
•	A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook containing all steps of the analysis, including code, visualizations, and narrative explanations of findings.
•	A presentation summarizing key insights and visualizations for stakeholders or peers.
This EDA project not only demonstrates your analytical and programming skills but also highlights your ability to derive meaningful insights from data, making it a valuable addition to your data analyst portfolio.

•	Purchase Date: Date and time of the transaction
•	Product Category: Category of the purchased product (e.g., electronics, clothing, groceries)
•	Quantity: Number of items purchased
•	Price: Total price of the transaction
•	Payment Method: Method used for payment (e.g., credit card, cash, digital payment)
•	Location: Store location where the purchase was made
Tools and Technologies:
•	Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) or Excel for data analysis
•	Data visualization tools (Tableau or Power BI) for creating dashboards


Data Wrangling 
Project Description: Data Wrangling for UCW Recruitment and selection Department
Project Title: Data Wrangling for Enhanced UCW Recruitment and selection Department
Objective: The primary goal of this project is to perform comprehensive data wrangling to prepare a robust dataset for UCW Recruitment and selection Department. By cleaning, transforming, and consolidating data from various sources, the project aims to enhance the accuracy and usability of customer data for subsequent analysis and reporting.
Background: UCW Recruitment and selection Department has accumulated customer data from multiple channels, including sales transactions, customer service interactions, and marketing campaigns. However, this data is often inconsistent, incomplete, or fragmented, making it challenging to derive meaningful insights. Effective data wrangling will facilitate better decision-making and more targeted marketing strategies.
Dataset: The data wrangling process will involve various datasets, including:
•	Applicant Tracking system
•	Interview Tracking System 
•	Referral Program System 
•	Requests to Recruit
Methodology:
1-	Data Collection:
o	Gather datasets from various sources, including internal databases, CRM systems, and third-party marketing platforms.
o	Ensure that all relevant datasets are identified for a comprehensive customer profile.
2-	Data Assessment:
o	Conduct an initial assessment of the data quality to identify issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies across different datasets.
o	Document data types, formats, and any discrepancies.
3-	Data Cleaning:
o	Address missing values through appropriate methods (e.g., imputation or exclusion) based on their significance and context.
o	Remove duplicate records and correct inconsistencies in data formats (e.g., date formats, naming conventions).
o	Normalize categorical variables to ensure consistency across datasets (e.g., standardizing customer status as "active," "inactive," etc.).
4-	Data Transformation:
o	Perform data type conversions to ensure that all fields are in suitable formats for analysis (e.g., converting strings to date time objects).
o	Derive new features that may aid in analytics, such as total purchase amounts, frequency of purchases, or customer tenure.
5-	Data Consolidation:
o	Merge datasets into a unified customer database, ensuring that all relevant information is linked accurately through unique identifiers (e.g., customer ID).
o	Create a comprehensive view of each customer by combining sales, support, and marketing data.
6-	Documentation and Validation:
o	Document the data wrangling process, including data sources, cleaning methods, and transformations applied to the dataset.
o	Validate the final dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA) to confirm accuracy and completeness.
Tools and Technologies:
•	Python (using libraries like Pandas and NumPy) or R for data manipulation and cleaning.
•	SQL for data extraction and initial assessment of data from relational databases.
•	Jupyter Notebook or RStudio for interactive data wrangling and documentation.
•	Visualization tools (like Matplotlib or Seaborn) to assist with EDA and quality checks.
